      <h1>arithmetic expression simulator for single digit natural numbers</h1>
    </header>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <h3>Used Frameworks:</h3>
    <p>None - The application is writen in plain JS, CSS and HTML.</p>

    <h3>Implemantation</h3>
    <p>The was implemanted with JS.</p>
    <h4>Datastructure</h4>
    <p>
      The grammar is internally represented in an array. Which holds all valid
      states. The generated arithmatic expression is stored in a string.
    </p>
    <h4>Algorithm</h4>
    <p>
      Until a terminal state in the arithmatic expression string is detected,
      the application replaces occurences of non terminal symbols with a
      randomly choosen symbol from the grammar. In a final step all symbols that
      would lead to a number are replaced with a random number.
    </p>
    <h3>Technical particularities:</h3>
    <p>
      Due to the fact that the genarator can genarate arbitrarily long
      arithmatic expressions, I skewed the distribution of possible replacements
      towards a higher occurence of final states to avoid unnecessarily long
      terms.

   <b>Original rules according to grammar</b>
      <pre>
        var rules = [
        'S+S',
        'S',
        'S-S',
        'S*S',
        'S/S',
        '(S)',
        'Z'
        ];
    </pre>
    <b>Rules used by application</b>
    <pre>
        var rules = [
        'S+S',
        'S',
        'S',
        'S',
        'S-S',
        'S*S',
        'S/S',
        '(S)',
        '(S)',
        '(S)',
        'Z',
        'Z',
        'Z',
        'Z',
        'Z',
        ];
        </pre>
        This ensures that a terminal state is more likely to be picked.
